ðŸš€ Steam Games in 2024: 
Revenue Insights and Projections
Between JANUARY and SEPTEMBER 2024, 
1,500 games were released on Steam, generating approximately $4 billion in revenue. ðŸ“ˆ
Breaking it down:
Average monthly revenue (Jan-Sep): $0.444 billion
Projected revenue for the remaining months (Oct-Dec): $1.333 billion
Total estimated revenue for 2024: If the current trend continues, Steam could see a total of $5.33 billion by year-end!


One game that stands out this year is Black Myth: Wukong, which made $838 million in just 21 days. Its impact on total revenue is undeniable! ðŸ’¥

Meanwhile, the release of Palworld coincides with a decline in revenue from AA publishers. I'm curiousâ€”what set this game apart from others released by the same publisher this year?

Here's a breakdown of revenue by publisher class:
AA: 37%
AAA: 40%
Indie: 22%
Hobbyist: 0.001%
Interestingly, the biggest portion of revenue came from mid-tier developersâ€” a space to watch for future growth! ðŸ”¥

Top developers like Game Science, Playstation, and Pocketpair dominate the charts, contributing to 68.85% of total revenue.

What do you think? Will this trend hold through the rest of 2024
