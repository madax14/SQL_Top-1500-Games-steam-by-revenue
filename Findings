## 1500 games released on the Steam platform between Jan/24 and set/24, with approximately 4 billion in revenue. 
Total revenue from January to September (9 months) is 4 billion.
Average monthly revenue = Total revenue / Number of months (Jan-Sep)
Average monthly revenue = 9 months / 4 billion
Project revenue for the remaining months (Oct-Dec)
Projected revenue for Oct-Dec = 0.444 billion / month x 3 = 1.333 billion
Estimate the total revenue for the year: If the trend continues, the total estimated revenue by the end of the year would be approximately 5.33 billion
This is based on the assumption that revenue remains consistent with the first nine months, and we need to consider that the Black Mith game had a significant impact on the total revenue.


​## Black Mith Wokong made in 21 days 838 millions of revenue;

## Publishers from the AA class have had a decrease in revenue since the Palworld release; I'm curious about what made this game stand out from the games released by the same publisher in the same year.

## Revenue by Publisher Class, AA 37%, AAA 40%, Indie 22% and Hobbyist 0.001% - The bigest revenue came from a mid-tier developers; 

## Top developers are Game Science, Playstation, and Pocketpair, together they have 68.85% of the total revenue;
